# Getting Started

Due to some annoyance with Conda messing up my Python installation, I've decided to use a virtual environment instead. 

## Using a Virtual Environment
First, make sure to have python installed.
Then, run
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After that run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Python Programs
Whenever running a Python program in a shell, make sure to have the virtual environment activated. (Again via the following)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Running Juypter Notebooks
VS Code has an extension to run Juypter notebooks. You can select to have the virtual environment activated when running the notebook.
